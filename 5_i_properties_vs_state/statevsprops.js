//1Ô∏è‚É£In Javascript we were storing value/data in "variable" or "object" or "array" etc.
//2Ô∏è‚É£But In ReactJS for storing value/data instead of "variable" or "object" or "array"
//   we use "properties" and "state".
//3Ô∏è‚É£So in React both "properties" and "state" are able to store the data/value, 
//  then what is the difference between them?
